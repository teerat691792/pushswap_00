The grade depends on how efficient the program's sorting process is.

Sorting 3 values: no more than 3 actions.
Sorting 5 values: no more than 12 actions.
Sorting 100 values: rating from 1 to 5 points depending on the number of actions:
5 points for less than 700 actions
4 points for less than 900
3 points for less than 1100
2 points for less than 1300
1 point for less than 1500
Sorting 500 values: rating from 1 to 5 points depending on the number of actions:
5 points for less than 5500 actions
4 points for less than 7000
3 points for less than 8500
2 points for less than 10000
1 point for less than 11500
Validating the project requires at least 80/100.
